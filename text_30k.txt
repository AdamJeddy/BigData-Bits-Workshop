20389	That happened on second-and-10.
20390	That has been a major question mark, one that has left the industry begging for clarity from the SEC and Congress about how the government views the “tokens” trade, which has produced billions in transaction fees for these major markets.
20391	That has implications for the national economy, which relies on community colleges to fill many of the jobs that have shortages.

20406	That is about the equivalent of two climbs up and down Mount Everest from sea level — or, in local terms, scaling and descending the Calgary Tower 114 times.

20417	That is neither conservative nor, as I view it, realistic.
20418	That isn’t a bad thing either as it at least gives the match some stakes, even if Beretta doesn’t seem like a heavy favorite in the title match.
20419	That isn't the case anymore.
20420	"That is one of the reasons I am at John Lewis today, they really opened their apprenticeship sector and also their driver training academy to make sure they can promote people in their business as well.”

20432	That is what the rule of law means."
20433	That is why he is elected by the people in the absence of constitutional process or in the absence of a vacuum.
20434	That is why many central bankers expect to raise interest rates slightly more and then hold them at a high level throughout 2023.
20435	That is why the Supreme Court’s (SC) landmark decision (CBK Case, published in April 2023) clarifying the tax incentives available to Renewable Energy Developers is very timely.
20436	That Jessie is a musician eases us into the musical-theatre world, McLarnon seeming to write songs on the hoof before Sievewright turns them into duets.
20437	That keeps fixed payments coming in and eliminates a substantial headwind that this sector faces when interest rates are on the decline.
20438	That kind of an event, we've been seeing it.
20439	That last action all happened on a penalty advantage and Scotland pepper the right side of the Romanian defence with carries near the line.

20453	That may be because Belarus’s enabling of Russia’s aggression has made people only more with Lukashenko.
20454	That may explain why Cooley, with his time running out, was hoping to have the matter dealt with now, and why other commissioners slowed it down.
20455	That means going to extremes to ensure that the other side loses.
20456	That means it’s pretty much “game over.”
20457	That means that Mann is tasked with coming back and working on the finer details.
20458	That means the 4K video looks good, though there’s no in-body stabilisation, so it may take a little time to master those smooth shots.

20488	That resonated with the couple, who were happy to entrust us with their house.”
20489	That’s a big claim about a larger, more complex story.
20490	That's according to a former U.S. attorney who did admit it will be perceived as a "political" problem -- but that has nothing to do with following the letter of the law.
20491	That’s actually the domain of Michael Aaron Rockland and Patricia Ard, whose vintage Morristown home was the setting for the 1998 film.

20508	That’s an invitation for someone to note the address and come and break a window… or worse.
20509	That's a recipe for good TV, and it's not even the first time Superman led a series like that.
20510	That's because is a body-horror movie about a podcaster who interviews a strange man with an unusual walrus obsession, and a desire to one day turn a person into a walrus.

20516	That's driving prices up as well.
20517	“That seems to be the case.”
20518	That's enough for me!

20520	That service is quite popular indeed.
20521	That’s far behind Iceland, the country with the highest density of public bathrooms: 56 per 100,000 people.
20522	That’s good news, as Montgomery will miss Sunday’s game with a ribs injury.
20523	That's hardly surprising given the prison's gloomy atmosphere.

20538	That’s kind of how my songwriting career started, just playing songs for my mom and writing songs in my room.

20544	That’s not designed by race.
20545	That’s not exactly what you want to hear if you’re Oversight Committee Chair James Comer, R-Ky., and you’ve been claiming that it’s clear that Biden has abused his office, as he before the hearing began.
20546	That's not our skill.
20547	"That's not the formula that we want to play to.
20548	That's not to say there aren't a ton of quality ice cream joints across the Garden State.
